# **A client-server game using Java sockets.**

Server Functionality:

Listens for incoming connections on a specific port (TCP connection).

Upon receiving a connection, the server reads data sent by the client.

The document suggests the server can be designed to:

Display the received data. (The example focuses on a Telnet client).

Client Functionality (Possible Implementation):

Connects to the server IP address and port.

Sends data (e.g., text messages) to the server.
